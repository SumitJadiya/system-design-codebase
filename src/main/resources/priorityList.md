Here’s a prioritized list of design patterns, tailored for interviews, focusing on those that are most commonly asked
and are crucial for software design discussions:

1. Singleton Pattern

   • Category: Creational
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Widely used to restrict object creation to a single instance, especially in managing shared resources like
   configuration settings, logging, and database connections.

2. Factory Pattern (Factory Method and Abstract Factory)

   • Category: Creational
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Helps decouple object creation from the client. Frequently asked in interviews to test understanding of
   object creation patterns, interface design, and dependency injection.

3. Observer Pattern

   • Category: Behavioral
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Commonly used in event-driven systems (like GUIs, real-time systems). It’s important for understanding how
   to establish one-to-many relationships and manage event-driven architectures.

4. Strategy Pattern

   • Category: Behavioral
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Used to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable. Demonstrates understanding of applying
   encapsulation to variations in behavior, making it a frequent interview topic.

5. Decorator Pattern

   • Category: Structural
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Used to add behavior dynamically to individual objects. It’s a common topic to evaluate knowledge of object
   composition, flexibility, and Open-Closed Principle (OCP).

6. Builder Pattern

   • Category: Creational
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Helps construct complex objects step by step. Demonstrates handling of complex constructors and immutable
   objects in interviews, especially when working with frameworks like Spring Boot or Lombok.

7. Adapter Pattern

   • Category: Structural
   • Importance: High
   • Reason: Converts the interface of a class into another expected by clients. Frequently used in legacy codebases or
   to integrate with external systems and libraries.

8. Command Pattern

   • Category: Behavioral
   • Importance: Medium
   • Reason: Encapsulates requests as objects. Important for undo/redo operations and queue-based systems, testing the
   candidate’s understanding of request processing and separation of concerns.

9. Prototype Pattern

   • Category: Creational
   • Importance: Medium
   • Reason: Important when dealing with object cloning and performance optimizations. Often asked to test understanding
   of object creation and cloning in Java.

10. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Important for decoupling senders and receivers of requests and creating flexible, loosely coupled systems.
    Often used in systems like exception handling, middleware, or processing pipelines.

11. Mediator Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Used to reduce complexity by centralizing communication between objects. Often used in UI design, chat
    applications, or systems with multiple interactions.

12. Template Method Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Demonstrates the use of inheritance to define a skeleton of an algorithm. Important in interviews to
    assess abstract class and inheritance usage.

13. Proxy Pattern

    • Category: Structural
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Used to control access to objects, typically in situations requiring lazy loading, security, or logging.
    Important in testing understanding of remote method invocation and lazy initialization.

14. Facade Pattern

    • Category: Structural
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Simplifies interactions with complex systems by providing a unified interface. Important for understanding
    system architecture simplification and code modularity.

15. State Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Used to allow an object to change behavior when its state changes. Useful for interview scenarios
    involving state machines, workflows, or systems where behavior depends on states.

16. Composite Pattern

    • Category: Structural
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Relevant in scenarios
    involving hierarchical structures like file systems or organizational charts.

17. Iterator Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Medium
    • Reason: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying
    representation. Important for understanding collection traversal and encapsulation.

18. Memento Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Medium-Low
    • Reason: Used to capture and restore an object’s internal state. Relevant for systems needing undo mechanisms but
    less commonly asked in interviews.

19. Visitor Pattern

    • Category: Behavioral
    • Importance: Low
    • Reason: Useful for performing operations on elements of an object structure. Complex and less frequently used in
    modern systems but demonstrates understanding of double dispatch.

20. Flyweight Pattern

    • Category: Structural
    • Importance: Low
    • Reason: Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. Important for optimization
    problems, but not a very common interview topic.

Top Patterns to Focus On for Interviews:

	1.	Singleton
	2.	Factory
	3.	Strategy
	4.	Observer
	5.	Decorator
	6.	Builder
	7.	Adapter

These patterns appear most frequently in interview questions and practical design discussions. Understanding them
deeply, including real-world use cases, trade-offs, and when not to use them, is key for acing design-related
interviews.
