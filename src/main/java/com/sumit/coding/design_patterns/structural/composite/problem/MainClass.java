/*
 * Issues with this Approach:
 *
 *	1.	Client Needs to Handle Both Types Differently: The client (Main) has to deal with both File and Folder separately, making the code harder to maintain and extend.
 *	2.	Code Duplication: If we need to add more behavior (like delete, move), weâ€™ll have to handle both File and Folder separately.
 *	3.	Not Scalable: The logic for handling a file and folder is scattered throughout the code.
