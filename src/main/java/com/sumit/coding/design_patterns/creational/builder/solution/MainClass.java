/*
 * Advantages of the Builder Pattern:
 *
 * 1. Clearer Object Construction: The CarBuilder class allows you to set only the parameters you care about, one by one, in a readable manner.
 * 2. Reduced Complexity: Optional parameters are clearly separated from required ones, and you donâ€™t need to pass them all at once.
 * 3. Extensibility: If new fields are added, you only need to add methods in the builder class, without modifying existing constructors.
 * 4. Immutable Objects: The Car object is immutable once created, as the fields are final and can only be set via the builder.
